# Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a retail sales dataset to uncover insights that can help improve inventory management, marketing strategies, and sales performance. The analysis includes identifying sales trends, top-performing products, and seasonal sales patterns.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Superstore Sales Dataset**, which contains sales information for a retail store. It includes details such as order date, product name, sales amount, and customer data.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)

## Project Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values, duplicate records, and convert date columns to datetime format.
2. **Sales Trend Analysis**: The sales data was grouped by month to visualize trends over time.
3. **Top-Performing Products**: Products were grouped by sales amount to identify the top 10 performers.
4. **Seasonal Patterns**: A seasonal analysis was conducted to understand how sales fluctuate across different months.

## Key Insights
